Hi! I'm **Kalyan Cheerla** — also known as *kc*, *gh0st*, or *kite* online.

I'm a software engineer, AI researcher, and homelab tinkerer with a passion for building and breaking systems. My interests span from **AI security** and **MLOps automation** to **privacy-respecting tooling** and **self-hosted infrastructure**. Whether it's developing secure protocols, automating workflows with open-source tools, or spinning up services in my home lab, I enjoy being hands-on with both code and systems.

Currently, I’m:

* Exploring the shift to **probabilistic systems** through LLMs, and how they enhance **deterministic** rule-based logic **(Rule-based Logic + LLMs = magic ✨)**.
* Trying to build a custom **Garbled Circuits framework** for secure computation.
* Blogging about tools, workflows, and technical learnings I wish I had found earlier.

Previously, I:

* Led a full-stack project ([*MedVoyage*](https://medvoyage.kalyanch.com)) from idea to deployment using Django, MySQL, Docker, and k3s
* Developed an extension ([MicroSvcsThreatsMapper](https://github.com/kalyancheerla/threatsmanager/tree/MicroSvcsThreatsMapper_Tool/Tools/MicroSvcsThreatsMapper)) to Threats Manager Studio to build threat models for microservices as part of research work.
* Teaching Assistant for the Secure Software Systems course over four semesters (approximately 2 years).

On this site, you’ll find my **blog posts**, **projects**, and thoughts around code, AI, security, and life as a developer.
