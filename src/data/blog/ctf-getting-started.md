## 🎯 My journey into CTFs

Like many others, I started by tinkering with Linux, solving small puzzles, and doing challenges on platforms like OverTheWire. Eventually, I began participating in actual CTFs (mostly online).

Recently, I took part in **CANSecCTF** at OU in Norman and ended up winning **2nd place (and a Nintendo Switch Lite 🎮)**. That lit a spark in me, and I've been hooked ever since.

## 🚩 What Are CTFs?

CTFs — or Capture the Flag competitions — are like digital treasure hunts in the world of cybersecurity. Participants solve puzzles to discover hidden strings called *flags*, like `flag{welc0m3_t0_TH3_w0r1d_0f_Cybers3curity}`, then submit them for points. Think hacking, pentesting — but legally, and for fun!

> Want the formal scoop? Check out [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)).

There are different flavors of CTFs:
- **Jeopardy-style:** Solve bite-sized puzzles in categories like crypto, web, reverse engineering, and more.
- **Attack-Defense:** Defend your machine while attacking others — fast-paced and team-based.
- **Real-World style:** Simulate real penetration tests or bug bounty scenarios.

Common challenge categories: [Web exploitation](https://ctf101.org/web-exploitation/overview/), [Binary exploitation](https://ctf101.org/binary-exploitation/overview/), [Cryptography](https://ctf101.org/cryptography/overview/), [Reverse Engineering](https://ctf101.org/reverse-engineering/overview/), [Forensics](https://ctf101.org/forensics/overview/), [OSINT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence), [Steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography), etc.

> 🐞 CTFs vs Bug Bounties: CTFs are great for learning in a controlled environment. Bug bounties are real-world — higher stakes, but higher rewards. Start with CTFs to build confidence.

## 👋 Adios

This blog's a work-in-progress — like all of us. I'm no guru, just curious (you should be too). Pick a challenge, break stuff, learn something.

Stuck? Need ideas? Ping me at [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/kalyancheerla) or [GitHub](https://github.com/kalyancheerla).

Happy hacking 🥷 — Bon voyage, KC.

## 🔓 Solution

* If you observe, string ends with `==`, a common sign of base64 encoding. Let's try decoding it.
```sh
🔥 echo "Wm14aFozdDVNSFZ5WDJGZlpuSmxRR3NoYm1kZlIyVnVhWFVrWDJKMVpDRjlDZz09Cg==" | base64 -d
ZmxhZ3t5MHVyX2FfZnJlQGshbmdfR2VuaXUkX2J1ZCF9Cg==
```
* Still looks base64-ish? Let's decode it again:
```sh
🔥 echo "Wm14aFozdDVNSFZ5WDJGZlpuSmxRR3NoYm1kZlIyVnVhWFVrWDJKMVpDRjlDZz09Cg==" | base64 -d | base64 -d
flag{y0ur_a_fre@k!ng_Geniu$_bud!}
```
* Boom! 🧨 You've got the flag.
