**VoxPilot is a privacy-first, voice-augmented AI assistant that lets you browse the web hands-free with natural, flexible commands â€” no rigid scripts, no data sent to servers. Designed for accessibility, productivity, and security, it runs entirely on-device, combining speech-to-text, natural language understanding, and action execution for a seamless browsing experience.**
