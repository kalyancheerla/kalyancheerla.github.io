**VoxPilot is a privacy-first, voice-augmented AI assistant that lets you browse the web hands-free with natural, flexible commands ‚Äî no rigid scripts, no data sent to servers. Designed for accessibility, productivity, and security, it runs entirely on-device, combining speech-to-text, natural language understanding, and action execution for a seamless browsing experience.**

### Things we wanted to achieve!
* Assistive AI navigation
* Assistive AI Summarization with Q/A prompting
* Assistive AI Form filling

## Team
* [Bhavani Rachakatla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhavani-rachakatla), [Kalyan Cheerla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalyancheerla)
* Mentor/Advisor: [Ron Dagdag](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rondagdag)

## Motivation
Many assistive tools still force specially-abled users to memorize rigid scripts, making web browsing frustrating and limiting. VoxPilot removes that barrier by enabling natural, flexible voice or text prompts for **navigation**, **summarization**, and **Q&A**, delivering a seamless, privacy-first browsing experience.

## How It Works
VoxPilot runs entirely on-device, combining built-in browser APIs for speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS), Gemini Nano for natural language understanding, and DOM-aware action execution. Instead of relying on server calls or rigid scripts, it interprets flexible prompts and maps them directly to browser interactions.

### Flow:
* üéôÔ∏è Capture voice input and convert it to text
* üß† Use Gemini Nano to parse intent and context
* üåê Embed DOM elements for navigation, summarization, or Q&A
* ‚ö° Execute actions instantly in the browser

## Current Limitations
* AI-assisted form filling is still a work in progress.
* Currently, Google's STT relies on the cloud for transcription; we are exploring on-device, browser-runnable STT models.
