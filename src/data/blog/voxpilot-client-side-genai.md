## TL;DR
VoxPilot is a privacy-first, on-device Chrome extension that lets you browse the web hands-free using natural voice or text prompts. It enables seamless navigation, content summarization, and Q&A without sending data to the cloud. Designed for accessibility and productivity, VoxPilot interprets flexible commands in real time using Gemini Nano and browser APIs. Form filling is coming soon!

## Introduction
VoxPilot is a privacy-first Chrome extension that lets users navigate, summarize, and interact with web content hands-free using natural voice or text prompts.

### Key Goals
* Assistive AI **Navigation**
* Assistive AI **Summarization with Q&A Prompting**
* Assistive AI **Form Filling**

* Mentor/Advisor: [Ron Dagdag](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rondagdag)

## Motivation
Many assistive tools still force specially-abled users to memorize rigid scripts, making web browsing frustrating and limiting. VoxPilot removes that barrier by enabling natural, flexible voice or text prompts for **navigation**, **summarization**, and **Q&A**, delivering a seamless, privacy-first browsing experience.

## How It Works
VoxPilot runs entirely on-device, combining built-in browser APIs for speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS), Gemini Nano for natural language understanding, and DOM-aware action execution. Instead of relying on server calls or rigid scripts, it interprets flexible prompts and maps them directly to browser interactions.

### Flow:
* üéôÔ∏è Capture voice input and convert it to text
* üß† Use Gemini Nano to parse intent and context
* üåê Embed DOM elements for navigation, summarization, or Q&A
* ‚ö° Execute actions instantly in the browser

## Current Limitations
* AI-assisted form filling is still a work in progress.
* Currently, Google's STT relies on the cloud for transcription; we are exploring on-device, browser-runnable STT models.
